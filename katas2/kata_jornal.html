                Do you enjoy the hustle and bustle of city life or dream of peace and quiet?
                Are you fascinated by towering skyscrapers and bright neon lights or favor the open sky and gentle moonlight?
                Do you wish for a vibrant and dynamic lifestyle or prefer a slower pace of life?
                If you find yourself leaning towards the second options, then it may be time to consider leaving the big city and moving to the country.
                Living a simple life in the country may seem like a dreadful experience to many, but it could be a dream come true for others. If you’re tired of the hectic lifestyle, constant noise, endless crowds, and cold indifference of the city, the idea of peace and serenity, lush greenery and close-knit communities might be quite appealing to you. Before deciding to move to the country though, you need to be well aware of the challenges of rural living as well.
                So, when wondering “Should I move to the country?”, be sure to look at both sides of the coin – read on to find out the advantages and disadvantages of moving to the countryside, so you can make the right decision and achieve the life of your dreams.

                As anyone who has spent time with cats knows, our feline companions are mysterious—much more so than those other furry family members. Here John Bradshaw, author of Cat Sense (Basic Books, 2013), fields a selection of questions submitted by Scientific American editors and Twitter followers about the cat’s many quirks. Bradshaw is a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences in England, where he studies the behavior and welfare of cats and dogs, as well as their interactions with people.
                Cats are far more similar to their wild ancestors than dogs are to wolves, so dogs are in that sense the more domesticated of the two species. As they adapted to living alongside humans, cats became more sociable with one another and much more accepting of people, but there is no evidence that they have changed much more than that over the past few thousand years.
